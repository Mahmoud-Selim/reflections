When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would do that if i don't always have access from the same local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because maybe someone is working on the same branch i am working on and added some changes before i finished and committed
    them to the repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    branches:
    	when you create multiple labels for different versions of code. say you want to fix a bug or add a feature without committing
    	to the main branch so you can always have a working version of the code, you then create a branch for the fix or adding the 
    	feature and merge it later when it is a product quality piece of code.
    forks:
    	They are like branches but on te github server. They allow you to make a fork of a whole repo in order to edit it and modify
    	it as you like -maybe the owner of the repo won't accept your commits or you want to edit it freely-
    clones:
    	They are used when you to are making a version of the code on your local machine. It copied the whole repo on the github
    	servers to your local machine and sets the remotes to the github repo automatically.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It could help making the merge easier as it doesn't need a internet connection to make it. 
    It can help while using the git hub commands such as viewing the difference or the log or status as now they are performed only on
    	an existing branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I think it would much harder to collaborate with others without using Git/GitHub as:
    	using git hub allows for storing old versions.
    	It makes it easy to compare different files.
    	It allows for making different versions of the code with different labels (branches)to allow for simultaneos update, code fix, etc...
    	It allows others to submit versions to the original version of the code with an easy way to compare the differences and eleminate any conflict.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I would make changes in a different branch in the following cases:
    	1- If i'm collaborating with other people.
    	2- If i want to have a product quality version of the code all the time (the original working version of the code.)
    	3- If i want to organize my work more and more.

    Benefits for having another branches:
    	1- Easy to collaborate with others.
    	2- Has a good version of the code all the time.
    	3- Makes it more easy to handle adding additional features or fixing bugs in the code.
    	
    Benefites for commiting to the master:
    	1- Easy to make commits only but it will be more difficult when collaborating with others.
